# Taguchi Factor Expansion Plan (L16 Two-Level Design)

The goal is to move from the current L8 (5 binary factors) to an L16 experiment so we can examine up to 15 two-level factors in a single batch (16 runs). The table below assigns letter labels following the Taguchi convention and lists the toggles we plan to sweep, using descriptive names instead of acronyms.

| Letter | Factor (two-level) | Level¬†1 | Level¬†2 | Notes / Equation | Status / Comments |
|--------|--------------------|---------|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **A** | **Spectral noise equalisation** (`spectral.freq_equalized_noise`) | Off ‚Äì standard Gaussian | On ‚Äì uniform spectral mask `m(k,‚Ñì) = ‚àö((r/r_min)^2 + 1)` | Existing factor. Keeps FFT noise energy spread across bands. | ‚úÖ Already in L8 ‚Äì carries into L16. |
| **B** | **Phase correction module** (`model.enable_phase_attention`) | Disabled | Enabled (multi-head attention on phase) | Formerly PCM. Applies attention to phase before IFFT. | ‚úÖ Existing factor; rename to ‚Äúphase correction module.‚Äù |
| **C** | **Reverse sampler** (`sampling.sampler_type`) | DDIM | DPM-Solver++ | Existing factor C. | ‚úÖ Already hooked up. |
| **D** | **Spectral adapters** (`spectral.enabled`) | TinyUNet (spatial) | SpectralUNet (complex FFT pipeline) | Existing mixed backbone factor. | ‚úÖ Stays as-is. |
| **E** | **Amplitude residual encoder** (`model.enable_amp_residual`) | Off | On | Isolates ARE contribution. | üÜï To wire into Taguchi runner. |
| **F** | **Frequency band smoothing** (MASF) | Off | On (MASF Œ±=0.9) | Per-band EMA smoothing in sampler. | üÜï Requires sampler toggle in runner. |
| **G** | **Uniform mask gain** | Full strength (1.0√ó) | Reduced gain (0.5√ó) | Partial vs full frequency equalisation. | üÜï Need to expose gain parameter. |
| **H** | **High-frequency loss weighting** (`loss.spectral_weighting`) | None | Radial weighting | Emphasise high-œâ in reconstruction loss. | üÜï Simple config toggle. |
| **I** | **SNR-based loss scaling** (`diffusion.snr_weighting`) | Disabled | Enabled | Loss scaled by SNR schedule. | üÜï Already supported; add to runner. |
| **J** | **Phase attention capacity** (`model.phase_heads`) | 1 head | 4 heads | Tests deeper PCM vs minimal. | üÜï Map Taguchi column to head count. |
| **K** | **Learning-rate schedule** | Constant LR | Cosine decay | Check if spectral stack likes decay. | üÜï Requires LR scheduler toggle. |
| **L** | **Sampling steps** (`sampling.num_steps`) | 50 | 100 | Spectral variants may need more steps. | üÜï Runner must override per design row. |
| **M** | **Coarse-resolution warm-up** | None | Short 8√ó8 pretrain before full run | Implements low-res warm-up. | üÜï Needs pipeline hook (run tiny warm-up). |
| **N** | **Spectral adapter placement** (`spectral.apply_to`) | Input only | Input + output | Tests adapter placement strategy. | üÜï Set list on config. |
| **O** | **Uniform mask formula** | Current sqrt mask | Alternative power-law mask | Compare mask definitions. | üÜï Implement second mask branch. |

> **Optional / Deferred:** FFT backend (CPU vs GPU) can become a future factor once GPU-native FFT is available. Cross-domain weight recycling is left out because the ablations showed little impact compared to the new toggles above.

### Future Research-Driven Candidates

The recent burst of frequency-domain diffusion work (2024‚Äì2025) surfaces several promising toggles that could slot into spare L16 columns or replace lower-impact ones. Each entry below keeps the binary Taguchi structure while highlighting why it might be worth piloting.

| Letter | Factor (two-level) | Level¬†1 | Level¬†2 | Why It‚Äôs Interesting | Status / Comments |
|--------|--------------------|---------|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **P** | **Fourier phase diffusion** | Implicit phase handling | Training-free phase-only diffusion branch | Enables zero-shot texture/style transfer via phase swaps (IJCAI 2025 reports large qualitative gains). | ü§î Prototype in sampler; pairs naturally with factor **B**. |
| **Q** | **Frequency prior filtering** | No frequency refinement | Adaptive magnitude filtering during diffusion | Preserves priors while removing low-frequency artefacts (OpenReview 2025, +15% FID). | üî¨ Needs configurable filter kernel before FFT inverse. |
| **R** | **Spectral autoregression** | Standard denoising | Autoregressive stepping over frequency bins | Reframes diffusion as causal AR in FFT space (Dieleman 2024 discussions). | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium-high effort; would stress-test sampler registry. |
| **S** | **Frequency-aware token selection** | Full token budget | Prune low-energy frequency tokens | 2‚Äì3√ó faster inference without retraining (AAAI 2025). | üöÄ Low effort once energy ranking is exposed; complements **L**. |
| **T** | **Adaptive spectro-temporal diffusion** | Spatial-only pathway | Joint STFT pathway for audio/time | Extends pipeline to audio while filtering artefacts (EURASIP 2025). | üí§ Defer until audio benchmarks are in place. |
| **U** | **Frequency-aware denoising loss** | Uniform loss weighting | Band-limited weighting (boost mid/high œâ) | Improves low-light/RF denoising (PMC 2025) and refines factor **H**. | ‚úÖ Low effort‚Äîloss reweighting already partially implemented. |
| **V** | **Spectral motion generator** | Static image FFT | 3D FFT over space-time volumes | Targets video diffusion; high buzz for motion synthesis (LinkedIn 2025 demos). | üü• High effort‚Äîrequires dataset & temporal heads. |

### Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Generated `configs/taguchi_spectral_L16.csv` containing the 15-factor L16 array; keep an L32 expansion on hold until these toggles are validated.
2. Extend `src/experiments/run_experiment.py` to interpret new columns and mutate the config accordingly (e.g., set LR schedule, warm-up flag).
3. Update the reporting pipeline to note the new factors in Taguchi summaries.
4. Run a pilot L16 batch to verify runtime footprint and metric quality.
5. Prioritise pilots from the future candidate list above (starting with **P/S/U**) and fold the top performers into the main Taguchi matrix.
