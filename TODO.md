# Spectral Diffusion TODOs

Legend: âœ… complete Â· ðŸŸ¡ in progress Â· â¬œ pending

| Status | Area | Current Status | Immediate Next Step | Dependency | Notes / Implementation Tip |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Pipeline architecture | S1 builders extracted; S2 CLI scaffolding live; training saves checkpoints; sampling writes metadata under `runs/<run_id>/samples/<tag>/` | Finish S3: document run layout, update Taguchi/smoke scripts, ensure evaluation artifacts integrate cleanly | None | Validate compatibility scripts (Taguchi, smoke tests) with new layout before removing legacy paths |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Spectral utilities | SpectralAdapter integrated (input/output/per-block) | Expand weighting options & adapter strength mixing | None | Adapter handles FFT/iFFT; timing & loss weighting tracked separately |
| âœ… | Spectral-weighted losses | Residual weighting via SpectralAdapter | Consider mixing strategies & per-frequency strength | Spectral utilities | Works with `loss.spectral_weighting` (none/radial/bandpass) |
| â¬œ | Spectral model research | Spatial UNet wrapped by FFT adapters | Prototype complex-valued SpectralUNet operating in frequency space | Spectral utilities | Manage real/imag parts explicitly; explore complex convolutions & spectral noise targets |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Diffusion sampling & image metrics | DDPM sampling callable post-training; sample metadata + evaluation CLI write metrics JSON | Add DDIM/other samplers and compute LPIPS/FID on outputs | Real training components | Samples now live under `results/runs/<run_id>/samples/<tag>/`; evaluation updates metadata when requested |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Sampler framework | Base `Sampler` class + registry live with DDPM implementation | Add registry registration helper tests + plug new samplers (DDIM, DPM-Solver++, ancestral variants) | Pipeline architecture | Keep legacy `sample_ddpm` shim for compatibility until downstream scripts migrate |
| â¬œ | Sampler support (DDIM/DPM-Solver++) | Fallback to DDPM currently | Implement DDIM solver + add DPM-Solver++ | Sampler framework | Necessary for fair spectral comparisons in arrays |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Taguchi S/N analysis | CLI `src.analysis.taguchi_stats` available | Integrate into batch workflow & notebooks | Taguchi runner outputs | Generates `taguchi_report.csv` with S/N ratios per factor |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Evaluation metrics | Folder-level MSE/MAE/PSNR, opt. FID via torchmetrics | Add LPIPS + integrate sampler outputs for FID/LPIPS | Diffusion sampling | Uses PIL & torchvision; warns if torchmetrics missing |
| â¬œ | Structured logging | Pending | Add JSONL logs & system metadata per run | Logging polish | Capture hardware info in `results/runs/<run_id>/system.txt` |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Testing / CI | Pytests for FFT, TinyUNet, Taguchi, training pipeline, CLI smoke tests, sampler registry | Next: (c) evaluate CLI suite with real metrics, baseline equivalence + CI workflow | Pipeline architecture | Reuse synthetic configs; keep CPU-only path fast |
| â¬œ | Logging polish | Console logging ready | Add CLI log-level flag & structured logs | Independent | Hook into CLI via `--log-level` |
| â¬œ | Dataset handling | Manual CIFAR download documented | Support auto-download flag + checksum validation | Network availability | Document dataset caching for CI/local |
| â¬œ | Documentation | README updated | Add `docs/theory.md` & `docs/experiments.md` with focused guides | None | Keep README concise, document flow-matching roadmap |
| â¬œ | Analysis notebooks | Not started | Plot loss vs time, FFT overhead vs efficiency, Taguchi summaries | Metrics & S/N tooling | Consume `results/summary.csv`, `taguchi_report.csv` |
| âœ… | FFT timing instrumentation | CPU/CUDA timing captured per adapter; metrics recorded | Report sampling/training breakdown in analysis scripts | Spectral utilities | Exposed as `spectral_*_time_seconds` and sampling counterparts |
| âœ… | Real training components | Diffusion training loop active (Îµ-pred, cosine schedule) | Next: v/x0 prediction, sampling utilities | Spectral utilities | Baseline-conv path remains for synthetic smoke tests |
| âœ… | Taguchi runner outputs | Per-run configs/metrics persisted | Next: S/N analysis & factor reporting | Metrics availability | Artifacts mirror single-run structure |
