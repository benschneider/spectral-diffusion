# Spectral Diffusion TODOs

| Status | Area | Current Status | Immediate Next Step | Dependency | Notes / Implementation Tip |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| â¬œ | Evaluation metrics (`src/evaluation/metrics.py`) | Basic metrics implemented | Extend with dataset-aware stats (e.g., FID/LPIPS placeholders â†’ real implementations) | Availability of metric dependencies | Use cached features to keep evaluation lightweight once implemented |
| â¬œ | Logging polish (`train_model.py`, `src/training/pipeline.py`) | Per-run file logging in place | Add optional console log level flag and structured JSON logs | Independent | Hook into CLI via `--log-level` to avoid noisy runs |
| â¬œ | Validation automation | `validate_setup.py` covers dry + fast real run | Integrate script into CI (GitHub Actions workflow) | Metrics + logging updates | Cache CIFAR-10 between CI runs or fall back to synthetic mode |
| âœ… | Taguchi runner outputs (`src/experiments/run_experiment.py`) | Persists per-run configs/metrics and summary entries | Add Taguchi S/N analysis and factor ranking utilities | Depends on metrics completeness | Artifacts now mirror single-run structure for downstream analysis |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Spectral utilities (`src/spectral/fft_utils.py`) | FFT round-trip + weighting masks available | Expose richer weighting schemes and connect to spectral-aware losses | Independent | Current options: `enabled`, `normalize`, `weighting` (`none`, `radial`, `bandpass`) |
| âœ… | Real training components | Diffusion training loop active (eps-pred, cosine schedule) | Add v/x0 prediction options, sampling utilities, and image outputs | Spectral utilities upgrade | Maintain baseline `baseline_conv` path for synthetic quick tests |
| ðŸŸ¡ | Testing / CI | Unit tests for FFT + TinyUNet spectral toggles added (`tests/`) | Add `tests/test_imports.py` and `tests/test_training_dryrun.py`; integrate pytest or simple runner | Validation script ready | Ensure determinism checks cover seeding and artifact generation |
| â¬œ | Dataset handling | CIFAR-10 loader with manual download instructions | Optionally enable auto-download flag and checksum validation | Network availability | Document dataset caching strategy for CI/local users |

**Recommended Execution Order**
1. Taguchi S/N analysis tooling
2. Spectral metrics & weighting extensions
3. Diffusion sampling & metrics (FID/LPIPS)
4. Dataset handling polish
5. Logging refinements
6. Testing/CI harness

Legend: âœ… complete Â· ðŸŸ¡ in progress Â· â¬œ pending
