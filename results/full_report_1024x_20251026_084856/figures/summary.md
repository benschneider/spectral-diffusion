## Synthetic Benchmark (generate different type of images, piecewise, parametric textures, random fields)
We compare how quickly the spatial TinyUNet and the spectral version learn to reconstruct tiny synthetic images. 

**Data families tested:**
- **Piecewise**: Structured patterns (checkerboards, stripes, circles) - tests discrete spatial feature learning
- **Texture**: Parametric gratings (oriented, controlled frequency/bandwidth) - tests directional frequency sensitivity
- **Random field**: Power-law spectra (1/f^α falloff) - tests natural image frequency statistics

**FFT Performance Context:**
- torch.fft.fft2 (CPU): 3.8ms per 256×256 image
- numpy.fft.fft2: 9.6ms per 256×256 image

**⚠️ Implementation Caveat:**
Spectral adapters currently rely on Python-level FFT calls, causing host-device sync overhead.
Wall-time results are implementation-limited. Step-based fit-rate metrics (k, t½) are the primary
indicators of convergence efficiency. We benchmark the FFT performance in isolation.

## Taguchi Factor Sweep
We run a Taguchi orthogonal array to see which frequency-processing settings and sampler choices matter most for convergence speed.

_Higher S/N (less negative) indicates a more robust configuration. Secondary columns show per-level averages for runtime, throughput, and final loss when available._

## FFT Benchmark Snapshot
Parameters: batch=4, channels=3, size=256×256, runs=10
- torch.fft.fft2 (CPU): 3.83 ms per call (total 0.038s)
- numpy.fft.fft2: 9.58 ms per call (total 0.096s)
- torch.fft.fft2 (CUDA): not available on this machine
_One-off measurement on local hardware; treat as qualitative guidance._

## FFT Overhead Correction
The benchmark suite measures transform overhead across resolutions.
FFT-corrected runtime t_corrected = t_measured × (1 - fft_fraction).
While not perfect, it allows theoretical extrapolation to GPU-native FFTs.
Scaling exponents p ≈ 1.8–2.0 indicate expected asymptotic flattening for spectral variants.

**⚠️ Implementation Caveat:**
Current spectral adapters use Python-level FFT calls, causing host-device sync overhead.
Wall-time results are implementation-limited. Step-based fit-rate metrics (k, t½) are the primary
indicators of convergence efficiency. We benchmark the FFT performance in isolation.

**📊 Scaling Analysis Methodology:**
- **FFT scaling:** Measured across resolutions 256² to 1536², fitted with power law time ~ N^p
- **Runtime scaling:** Training time vs resolution for baseline vs spectral models
- **Efficiency metrics:** k (convergence rate) and k/runtime (normalized efficiency)
- **FFT correction:** t_corrected = t_measured × (1 - fft_fraction) for fair comparison
